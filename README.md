# **Built with**

##### To create our search engine, we used 2 libraries:
-  To create a console utility, the ```argparse``` library was used


-  Since the data about all the movies was stored in csv files, we used the built-in python library ```csv```  
###### Each library used in our program is already built into the python language, so there is no need to resort to installing additional modules
